# trex-game-automation
this is a automation of trex-game (dinosaur game when internet down)  

This uses python libraries like pyautogui,numpy etc...

In this game the dinosaur is actually in the same position on the screen , and the objects like trees and birds are coming towards it.
we use a box to capture a screen part infront of the dinosaur and when an object comes into it , the color values changes inside the box, thus we make the dinosaur jump.
